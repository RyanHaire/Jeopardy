-- LoginServlet.java --
LoginServlet.java creates a "player" session attribute holding 
an instance of a Player.java object so every 
servlet and page that uses the Player.java object can use
methods to modify Player data like score and how many questions
the user has clicked on. Also creates a "questionFactory"
session attribute holding an instance of a QuestionFactory.java
that contains all the questions for other servlets and pages
to display questions and answers. 
This servlet uses "questionFactory" attribute to randomly set 2 questions
to daily doubles.

-- PickQuestionServlet.java --
When a question is a daily double and user enters a bid, 
PickQuestionServlet.java gets the player score to check if bid amount is 
matching requirements of how much they are allowed to bid. Also uses "questionFactory"
to loop through the questions and answers so question-select.jsp displays the correct
question that was selected. During the loop it creates a "currentQuestion" session
attribute so question-select.jsp can display the category, question, answers and get 
the question value. It gets the question from "questionFactory" and sets it to answered
so game-board.jsp knows which questions to disable. 

-- AnswerSelectServlet.java -- 
AnswerSelectServlet uses the "player" and "currentQuestion" session attributes to
check if user answer is correct or wrong and modfies player score depending on if 
user is correct or wrong. This servlet creates "userCorrectBool", "modalHeader", 
and "modalBody" session attributes for game-board.jsp to display a modal with
corresponding values.

-- game-board.jsp --
Uses "userCorrectBool", "modalHeader", and "modalBody" session attributes for 
display modal. If "userCorrectBool" is true then a modal stating the user is correct 
is displayed otherwise stating the user is incorrect. Also uses "questionFactory"
attribute to get questions and create links associated with question category and value.
Aswell uses "player" to get player username and winnings to display for user.

-- question-select.jsp --
Uses "currentQuestion"  to display category title, question and associated answer 
options to the user. If "currentQuestion" is a daily double it will display the 
new value of the question for the user.

-- daily-double.jsp -- 
Uses "player" session attribute to get player score and checks if player score is
less than 1000 and displays max bid as 1000 or displays player score if as max bid if
greater than 1000.

-- player-wins.jsp -- 
Uses "player" session attribute to display player username and final winnings when 
game is done.
